Eat da Burger App
A Burger Eatin' Application with Node.js/Express/MySQL/Handlebars

Overview
This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The burger entry is added to the Burgers to Devour section on the top of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it, which moves it to the Burgers Devoured section and updates its status accordingly in the database.
